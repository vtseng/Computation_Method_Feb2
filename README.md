# Computation_Method_for_IS_Research


This code is aimed to visualize the frequency spectrums for different activities by caculating the fft for each accelerometer log file.


Installiation:
Before you run this code, please make sure you have scipy, numpy and matplotlib installed.

Execution:
1. Before excution, you can set up different values for the two paramters, 'fileNum' and 'dirPath', which represent the number of files and the activity you want to visualize respectively. Note you just need to change the sub-directory name of 'HMP_Dataset'.
2. All the data is included in the "HMP_Dataset" directory, which is obtained from UCI Machine Larning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer), so just click "run" and the code will start running.
3. Then a window will pop up, showing all the frequency spectrums for the accelerometer log files you chose.
