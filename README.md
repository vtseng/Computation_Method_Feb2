# Computation_Method_for_IS_Research


This code is aimed to visualize the frequency spectrums for different action by caculating the fft for each accelerometer log file.


Installiation:
Before you run this code, please make sure you have installed scipy, numpy and matplotlib.

Execution:
1. Before excute this code, you can set up different values for the two paramters, fileNum and dirPath. "fileNum" represents the number of 
2. All the data is included in the "HMP_Dataset" folder, which is obtained from UCI Machine Larning Repository(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dataset+for+ADL+Recognition+with+Wrist-worn+Accelerometer), so just click "run" and the code will start running.
3. Then a window will pop up, showing all the fft plots for the accelerometer log data you chose.
